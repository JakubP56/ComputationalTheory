# Computational Theory

This repository contains a jupyter notebook that constitutes my assessment submission for the Computational Theory Module at ATU Galway. The aim of the notebook is to provide an analysis of the Countdown Numbers Game. Firstly, I provide an explanation of the game and give an example of the game in action. Following the explanation, I delve into an analysis of the computational complexity of the game and provide various approaches to solving the game, namely: Brute Force Approach, Reverse Polish Notation and Recursion. Lastly, I will evaluate my findings from solving the problem using various approaches.

# Running the Notebook

In order to run the notebook in this repository, firstly clone the repository onto your computer as follows:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JakubP56/ComputationalTheory
```

Next, Install the required packages. While creating this notebook, I used Anaconda as my package manager. If not already installed,
you can download Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/download.

To install Jupyter:

```bash
    conda install -c anaconda jupyter
```

To install the Qiskit package:

```bash
    pip install qiskit
```
To install the Numpy package:

```bash
    pip install numpy
```
    
Now that the necessary software is installed, navigate to the repository

```bash 
    cd ComputationalTheory
```  
From here, you can finally run the Jupyter Notebook as follows:

```bash 
    jupyter notebook
```
