    "# Explanation of the Countdown Numbers Game\n",

    "The Countdown Numbers Game allows people to showcase their math skills on a British aired TV Show, Countdown. The aim of the game is to reach a specific target number using a set of six other numbers and basic arithmetic operations. In order to better understand the game, I have come up with the following breakdown of how a round of Countdown works.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The player selects six numbers from two groups : The first group consisting of four large numbers: 25, 50, 75, and 100. The other group holds twenty smaller numbers ranging from 1 to 10, with each number appearing twice. The player has the freedom to use any combination of numbers from these two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The game generates a target number, a three digit number.\n",
    "- The player is then given a 30 second window and is given the task of using a combination of arithmetic operations in order to come as close as possible to the target number. Each of the six numbers can be used once and players are not obliged to use all six numbers. The operations must however result in a whole number at every step.\n",
    "- The score is determined by the closeness of the player's number to the target score. A perfect score of 10 is awarded to players where they have reached the target number.\n",

    "\n",
    "*The Problem:* In the game, a player is given six numbers and must use arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to reach a randomly generated three-digit target number. The operations must result in whole numbers, and each of the six numbers can be used at most once.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to analyse the computational complexity, it is necessary to consider how difficult it is to find a solution to reach the target number using a set of numbers and arithmetic operations. This analysis typically focuses on the theoretical limits of solving this problem using algorithms, and the complexity can be described in terms of both time and space (memory). \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary challenge is the *combinatorial nature* of the problem. For each of the six numbers, there are decisions about:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Whether to use the number or not.\n",
    " - Which arithmetic operation to apply.\n",
    " - Which other number to combine it with.\n",
    "\n",
    "As there are four operations and up to five other numbers to combine with, the possibilities increase exponentially with each step.\n",
    " \n",
    "*Permutations:* The numbers can be arranged in 6 different ways, resulting in a factorial of 6\n",
    "\n",
    "*Operations:* At each step between two numbers, you can apply one of four operations. If you consider operations between pairs of numbers, the number of operational combinations also increases rapidly.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Branching Factor:* If we take a decision tree approach, each level of the tree would involve choosing a number (up to 6 choices), choosing another number (up to 5 remaining choices), and picking an operation (4 choices). This results in a branching factor of 6 x 5 x 4 = 120 at the first level of the decision tree alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Time Complexity:* We can consider the time complexity of the problem to be exponential when considering all permutations and combinations of operations and number uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Space Complexity:* The space complexity of this problem refers to the need of storing results and calculations. Like the time complexity, this grows with the number of calculations.\n",

    "# Implementing Countdown using a Brute Force Approach\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The Brute Force Approach is the first approach to solving the game that I demonstrate in this notebook. This approach was explained by the author of(https://www.daitx.com/2016/05/01/countdown-math/), where he also takes a brute force approach to the problem and pays attention to reverse polish notation. In this approach, you must generate all the  possible number and operation combinations and evaluate each combination to see if it can produce the target number. This implementation solves the problem by creating all possible permutations of operations and numbers. It then checks each permutation to see if it is equal to the target number. Using this approach ensures that a solution will be found if it exists however it comes with the cost of a high computational complexity which I confirm by using Big O notation and measuring time complexity.\n",

    "Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), also known as postfix notation is a mathematical notation invented in the 1950s that places the arithmetic operator after the arguments it is being operated on. In RPN there is no need for brackets to indicate the grouping of the terms, instead the expression is evaluated from left to right. This simplifies the computation of the expression which is highly favourable in the problem of solving the Countdown numbers game.(https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ReversePolishNotation.html) \n",
